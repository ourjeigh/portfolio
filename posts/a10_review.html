		Sony PCM-A10 Review
		<div class="contentDate"> 2020 </div>

	<div class="contentDescriptionJustify">
		Last year I set out to find myself a handheld field recorder, like so many audio folks before me. It's a
		challenging task with so many options, and after a fair amount of research I settled on the <a
			href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1447756-REG/sony_pcm_a10_high_resolution_audio_recorder.html"
			target="_blank"> <u> Sony PCM-A10</u></a> ($230). I’ve seen a lot of tweets and slack messages asking for
		field recorder recommendations, but don't often see the follow-ups of what people settled on and how they like
		it. I wanted to give a quick explanation of what I was looking for, why I picked the A10, and how it’s been
		treating me for just over a year now. I’ll say right now that I really like the thing!
		<br /><br />
		<img height="auto" src="../images/a10blog/tripod.jpg" width="100%" />
		<br /><br />
		Obviously I wanted something portable, but honestly I wanted something <i> really </i> portable. I’ve heard so
		many people say “the best recorder is the one you have on you,” which was exactly the problem I wanted to solve
		with this device. I had a Zoom H4n years ago, and aside from not really liking the way it sounded or the UI, it
		was just big enough that I never ended up having it on me. I have some microphones and access to a MixPre
		through work, but due to bulk I only really carry them around if I know I’m setting out to record. As a result,
		I didn’t need a recorder with XLR input, though being able to plug in a pair of LOM mikroUSI would be a big
		plus. I wanted something that sounded good of course, but I cared more about size and ease of use.
		<br /><br />
		One of the best resources I found was <a href="https://mindful-audio.com/blog/handheld-recorder-review"
			target="_blank"> <u> George Vlad’s Handheld Recorder Review</u></a>. His review did such a good job of
		explaining the differences between several of the options I was considering. The biggest thing I had to remind
		myself while reading his review is that George is a <i> much </i> different recordist than I am (and I mean that
		in the absolute best way), which I think is why his experience with the A10 has been so different from mine.
		While George is taking his gear out on lengthy international excursions, often leaving a recorder out for days
		at a time, I'm just trying to capture the sound of a train as I'm stuck waiting to cross the tracks on a
		bikeride or some cool wave crashes while I walk on the beach. As a result, some of the negative aspects of his
		review seemed totally acceptable for my goals.
		<br /><br />
		I really picked the A10 for its size, but here’s a selection of selling points that helped me decide:
		<ul>
			<li> $230. Not the cheapest option, but definitely on the lower end.
			<li>7+ hr internal memory at Stereo 96/24 PCM</li>
			<li>PIP Mic In</li>
			<li>3 onboard mic configurations (XY/Straight/Wide)</li>
			<li>Bluetooth + Free App</li>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<img height="auto" src="../images/a10blog/pixelcompare.jpg" width="100%" />
		<br /><br />
		As soon as it arrived, I felt reassured about the size. It’s much smaller than my Pixel 3 Phone in height and
		width, and only maybe 3x thicker. I bought a case for it to carry accessories, but I frequently just carry it
		around in a pocket. I think it sounds good. I know it’s not the best sound out there, but I consistently feel
		that it captures what I find interesting in a source, which is good enough for me! I’ve used A10 recordings for
		production assets on many occasions.
		<br /><br />

		It boots up pretty quickly as well, going from pressing power to actively recording in about 3 seconds. I've
		definitely started rolling just in time on more than one occasion!
		<br /><br />

		I’ve really liked that both charging and transferring is a single USB, no batteries to swap out or SD Cards to
		remove. I got a generic USB extension cable to plug it in while sitting on my desk so I don't have to worry
		about it jutting out dangerously from a CPU tower. It has a Micro SD card slot, but I’ve never needed it as I’m
		rarely recording 7h without getting back to a computer to charge and backup. I will say, the transfer speed when
		backing up is very slow. I have no idea why, but it takes around 5mins to transfer 1gb of audio.
		<br /><br />
		<img height="auto" src="../images/a10blog/stream.jpg" width="100%" />
		<br /><br />

		I figured the Bluetooth functionality and accompanying REC Remote app would be more music oriented and not
		useful in the field, but I actually think it’s fantastic. It exposes all the functionality I find I need for
		controlling remotely: start/stop, gain setting, dropping markers, &amp; changing settings. Just last week I
		setup the A10 next to a bird feeder outside and was able to start/stop and drop markers from inside while
		watching out the window for bird visitors.
		<br /><br />

		It's really easy to drop markers while recording, but I haven't found a way to access them without using some
		proprietary Sony app which I have little interest in. I wish it would embed a flag in the wav file itself.
		<br /><br />

		It says you can listen via Bluetooth which I assumed meant you could hear the signal from the app when
		connected, but I think it just means you can play it back by connecting a Bluetooth speaker or headphones which
		I've never done.
		<br /><br />
		Lastly, it has some internal processing which I tried out briefly and would advise against. The noise cut made
		everything unusably thin.
		<br /><br />

		Again someone with different uses in mind might generate a completely different list, but here's my pro/con
		breakdown.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Pros</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Small</li>
			<li>Turns on fast. Power up to recording in under 3s.</li>
			<li>Single USB port for charging/transfer</li>
			<li>Able to access files from my phone with USB adapter!</li>
			<li>Decent internal mic quality, really great USI quality!</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Cons</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Markers need to be opened with proprietary app</li>
			<li>Very slow transfer times</li>
			<li>Can’t hear signal via Remote app</li>
			<li>Internal processing is not great </li>
		</ul>

		As I mentioned, I do take my A10 around by itself, but I decided to put together a minimal “rig” of accessories
		that’s still small enough to fit into a backpack or my panier when I’m biking around. Here’s what’s inside:

		<br /><br />
		<img height="auto" src="../images/a10blog/casecontents.jpg" width="100%" />
		<br /><br />
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1447756-REG/sony_pcm_a10_high_resolution_audio_recorder.html"
					target="_blank"> A10 ($230) </a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KQGNH4" target="_blank"> Rycote Mini Windjammer ($30)
				</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://store.lom.audio/products/mikrousi" target="_blank"> LOM mikroUSI (Stereo) ($105 + $50
					for windbubbles)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087FFTT2/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_QFWmFb2V6Z4RA" target="_blank"> Joby
					GorillaPod Stand ($15) </a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E9GQEE" target="_blank"> Pelican 1040 Case ($25) </a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		With everything altogether, it's about a $450 setup. I think it's a pretty good value for how versatile it ends
		up being. If I find myself in the presence of an interesting sound, I feel pretty confident I have what I need
		to get a good recording. And even with a slightly beefier case than I probably need, it still weighs less than
		500g, light enough to take on hikes where every gram counts!
		<br /><br />

		<br /><br />
		I won't give this any kind of star rating or anything because I think the A10 will be better for some than
		others, but I will say I use it all the time which is exactly what I wanted from a handheld recorder. If you're
		looking yourself, good luck! I hope this helps.
