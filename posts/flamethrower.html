        I was working on the Flamethrower auxiliary weapon for Iron Man and was struggling to find source with the sort
        of big gestures that the player is able to do with the wave of their arm in game. I discovered they let you buy
        a real life flamethrower at the hardware store (technically it's a weed-burner, but that's less thrilling) and
        had to find out what it could do.
