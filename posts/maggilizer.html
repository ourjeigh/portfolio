		I've wanted to make a Wwise Plugin for a long time, and after watching the recent 
		<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/758625080" target="_blank"><u>Wwise Up On Air </u></a>
		 discussing how to
		get started with development, I decided now was a good time to give it a shot. The folks at AudioKinetic have
		done a lot of streamlining to the setup process that had previously made Wwise Plugin creation a bit too
		daunting of a task. I highly recommend giving the video a watch.

		I thought a fun place to start might be mimicking one of my long-time favorite plugins, <a
			href="https://www.soundtoys.com/product/crystallizer" target="_blank"> <u>SoundToys Crystallizer</u></a>.
		Since all of its manipulations deal with time and not frequency, it's hopefully a bit easier than diving right
		into FFTs and the like. I'm choosing to implement a smaller subset of features for what I'd consider the core
		functionality that I really love about Crystallizer, so a lot of the "Tweak" knobs will be omitted (for now).

		<br /><br />
		The plugin is still a work in progress up on <a href="https://github.com/rjmattingly/MaggiLizer"
			target="_blank"><u> GitHub</u></a>. You can grab the latest release files <a
			href="https://github.com/rjmattingly/MaggiLizer/releases/latest" target="_blank"><u> here</u></a>. Both the
		.dll and .xml files just need to be placed in your Wwise Authoring App's Plugins folder. My focus so far has
		been on the Authoring App plugin, so it's not yet ready to drop into a game engine.
