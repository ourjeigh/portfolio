		ReaTransmission allows you to stream audio directly from Reaper into an instance of the Wwise
		Authoring App or a game engine running Wwise, hearing your DAW sounds in game immediately! A Reaper
		extension captures the audio signal from the DAW, and a Wwise Source plugin controls Reaper playback
		and routes the Reaper signal though the Wwise engine. Once an instance of ReaTransmission is setup,
		sounds and FX can be added, removed, and modified in Reaper	and all changes are heard live. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The video above demonstrates some of its capabilities with two examples: a 2D one-shot projectile, 
		and a 3D positional looping sound.
