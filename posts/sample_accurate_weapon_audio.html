        I had heard anecdotes about a solution to the sync/stutter issues of high rate of fire weapon audio, sometimes referred to as "MIDI Weapons," but wasn't able to find a lot of technical information about it.
        After getting it working, I thought it might be helpful to share what I learned as well as the approach I took.
