		Unity does not provide a simple way to export animations, something both audio and animation teams needed to deliver
		to external content providers. The previous method was using a screen capture tool like QuickTime or Fraps to
		capture each animation by hand, which took a lot of time and was not reliably frame-accurate.
		<br /><br />
		I built this tool to capture multiple characters' animations automatically. As an offline tool it works faster than
		realtime, is frame-accurate, and organizes videos based on character name and animation. Best of all, it can handle
		a large number of animations and efficiently moves from one to the next while the user enjoys a nice cup of coffee.
