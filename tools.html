        Managing a Wwise Project of any size is challenging. Whether you are a single contributor, or a team of dozens, it can be difficult to keep up with all the changes going into the project with the frenzy of production schedules. Mistakes are easy to make, but can be hard to catch. Often the difference between content working perfectly and an egregious bug is a single checkbox.
        <br><br>
        The Wwise Offline Tests tool allows you to define and enforce rules about how content should be setup within a Wwise Project. These rules can range from nice to have (eg naming conventions) to critical (eg a sound that should attenuate but doesn't). Once these tests are defined, it's quick and easy to check for issues frequently, either manually or as part of an automated process.
        <br><br>
        Fundamentally, a Wwise Test is a single Wwise Query which should expect to find no results. Test queries are written in such a way that they only find incorrect Wwise data. For example: if you consider it to be problematic for content to be routed directly to the Master Audio Bus, then a Wwise Test could search for any content that is routed to the Master Audio Bus. When a test finds any results, that test has “Failed” and issues will be listed out so they can be addressed.
